# Modern Portfolio-Theory
 
Hello guys, this is some of the demonstration of the power of Python in transforming our theoretical lectures on CFA Portfolio Management into visualization and simulation. Of course, you can choose Excel for Portfolio Management but it's gonna takes more time and resources, as well as its reusability.

I first wrote this a few months ago, during my Portfolio Management module which was quiet theoretical even though our lectures were based on the CFA Level I programme. 

In this case, for the risk and return estimation, I will apply the 1 year historical data for portfolio visualization. Of course, there are many stock valuation approach. I hope to write down some code for them in the near future.
